# Web Portal Mechanism

## 1)Abstract

We all know that when you are developing a software then one of the most important thing is the user interface. It is simply because user interface is the first impression that a user experiences. So in order to develop an interest we have to make an interface that looks appealing to the user. So here I have created a fully functional web portal for my college UPES which gives you a complete information and overview about the college. So a lot of students complain about their busy schedule, unsuitable class timings and being not able to be taught by their preffered faculty. So we have created a mechanism in which a student can easily set its own timetable according to its comfortability. It will solve a big problem of many students studying in different educational institutions.

## 2)Methodology

So in order to make implement this model we have used a proper login system in which each student will fill its credentials and after that the student will choose a particular subject and the faculty he prefer to be studied from. So we have divided it into three categories. The first category is the category of faculty. So firstly a faculty has to set it's timetable in such a way that if a faculty chooses a particular room number at a particular time then some other faculty cannot choose the same room number at the same time. Each faculty will login and will set their timetable. Second category is the category of students, so when a student will login then he will get an option to set it's own timetable , so he will be shown the timetable set by the faculty so that student will choose the day and the time in which he is comfortable. Now the third category is the category of admin so it will have access to both the student and faculty categories. This whole process will depend on First Come First Serve basis. So in case the slots of a particular faculty are full then student has to choose some other faculty.

## 3)Motivation

There is a big problem for the freshers that in the initial days after the admission students find difficulties in many things , for example if a student wants to know about the activities being held in the university, or if the student has any kind of problem then whom to approach , so this portal provides you with all the links which will help you to find the proper centres that will help the student to resolve the issue. Not only this if a person either enrolled or not who wants to know anything about our college then also he can go to the website and will find each and everything he is looking for. Nowadays students bunk their classes because of the unsuitable time or students don't find the teaching style of the faculty appealing. So in order to solve this big issue we have designed this web portal where each student will have the privilege to choose their preferred faculty and the time slots according to their comfortability.
